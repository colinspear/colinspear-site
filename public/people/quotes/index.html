 Everything is interesting of you build a mental model for it
 Agnes Callard on the Ezra Klein Show, minute 40:
 I think we&rsquo;re way too quick to identify ourselves with the long term goals, especially when we are not in the moment of being tempted. So we can say, look I know how I should really live. I know that I should really read those books, and I should not not eat the cookies and I should be less stressed about these things; I should spend more time with my family." />

<p>I think we&rsquo;re way too quick to identify ourselves with the long term goals, especially when we are not in the moment of being tempted. So we can say, look I <em>know</em> how I should really live. I <em>know</em> that I should really read those books, and I should not not eat the cookies and I should be less stressed about these things; I should spend more time with my family. These are things  I <em>know</em>. And I think the truth is that I really do not know any of them. I believe them and then I also believe the opposite. And some of my beliefs are more presentable to other people. So I am more presentable to you if I say, yeah I know I should really spend more time with my kids than if I say I have a profound need to escape my kids. But both of those things are true of me. And I think that the violence to the self occurs as long as they are both true of you. I think, but this is really just me agreeing with Socrates about something, that if you had knowledge, you would not have that conflict. And a lot of people have that goal of mastering themselves - which is to say exerting enough violence over themselves to silence, to quiet that other voice because they &ldquo;know&rdquo;, they say they know, that other thing. But the truth is that the fact that the other voice is there means you don&rsquo;t know it and the violence against the self is the kind of trying to quiet it when it is really there.</p>
