Yet when humans thought about physical laws they prefered to work with them in their causal formulation. I could understand that. The physical attributes that humans found intuitive, like kinetic energy or acceleration were all properties of an object at a given moment of time.

In contrast, the physical attributes that the heptopods found intuitive like action or those other things defined by integrals were meaningful only over a period of time. And these were conducive to a teleological interpretation of events. By viewing events over a period of time, one recognized that there was a requirement that had to be satisfied, a goal of minimizing or maximizing, and one had to know the initial and final states to meet that goal.
