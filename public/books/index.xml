      <description>7% : The winds of the world known by the patient. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely passage. The Wikipedia page on the winds of the world is not nearly as beautiful, but also very cool.
30% : The sapper. The man who defused the landmines left behind by the retreating German military. Kip.
42% : Their distance gives them a private energy. Was this the inspiration for the Helado Negro album?</description>

      <description>Contains spoilers
This was a great novella. A slow burner, it drops its core themes quickly and densely about three quarters of the way through. Language, time, free-will, purpose, parenting are all front and center in this very human human-alien encounter. I love stories that focus on that slippery line between what we have the ability to change and what we don&amp;rsquo;t and how we make sense of this partial self-determination.</description>

      <title>Orwell - Essays</title>

      <description>Essays by George Orwell So much of his worldview seems to be about his experience of violence and the political context in which he experienced it.
The scale and scope of violence that was part of European life in the first half of the 20th century is so hard to fathom. Reading Orwell really drives home the idea that this experience was such a formative part of not just political, financial and public life, but the way in which people forged their beliefs and their sense of self - who they were in the world and the ways in which they understood themselves and their role in society.</description>

      <title>A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age</title>

      <description>A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age by Jimmy Sony &amp;amp; Rob Goodman Information is divorced from content. This was one of the fundamental insights leading up to Shannon&amp;rsquo;s work. Information is not about what you send, it&amp;rsquo;s simply about what you can send, or the set of things you can send. This is kind of amazing to me: developing the technologies that have given us so many platforms for expressing our weirdness and individuality was only possible by ignoring all of that stuff in the first place.</description>

      <description>Conjectures and Refutations by Karl Popper  Contrasts the Empiricists (the philosophers that saw truth as something stemming from natural observation) with the rationalists (those that believed truth is something to be found through intellectual intuition) His argument is that both of these camps are not really that different at all. They both believe truth to be something whole that can be obtained in full in one way or the other.</description>

      <description>Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson Introduction  That followed Leonardo&amp;rsquo;s injunction to begin any investigation by going to the source: he who can go to the fountain does not go to the water jar.
 Themes  Iteration and going deeper. The revisiting if the painting&amp;rsquo;s neck twenty years after the initial painting to correctly render the two sternocleidomastoid muscles after human dissection in 1510. Beginning from foundations. First you must paint the skeleton, then move outward.</description>

      <description>Tristes Tropiques&#39; by Claude Levi-Strauss  Mankind has opted for monoculture
 From early in the book, perhaps from the introduction. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall precisely.
Chapter 9   The ground that his observations cover is truly remarkable. In chapter 9, Guanabara, he goes from travelogue to France&amp;rsquo;s early colonial history in Brazil to urban design over the course of only a few paragraphs.
  He speaks of the way that places have ceased to shock and surprise in the way they once did before the sustained contact between colonial and native cultures.</description>

      <description>Music: A Subversive History by Ted Gioia Krause describes a memorable encounter with an elder of the Nez Perce tribe named Angus Wilson, who chided him one day: “You white people know nothing about music. But I’ll teach you something about it if you want.” The next morning, Krause found himself led to the bank of a stream in northeastern Oregon, where he was motioned to sit quietly on the ground.</description>

      <description>Klara and the sun by Kazuo Ishiguro  If Klara is super intelligent, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t she know basic facts about the sum, solar system, planetary motion, etc? There is clearly some sort of some theology. Is it because the sun is all important to their existence that their creators programmed this strange theology in place of basic science? I realize now after having finished the book what an anthropocentric viewpoint the above comment takes.</description>
