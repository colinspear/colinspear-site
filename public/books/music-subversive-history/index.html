Can you tell an oak from a maple by ear?” Their homework is to “go out, pour their attention into their ears, and harvest sounds.” For him, “it’s an almost meditative experience. And from that, you realize that trees sound different, and they have amazing sounds coming from them.” Moreover, the music of nature guides us through life cycles and seasonal patterns. “Our unaided ears can hear how a maple tree changes its voice,” Haskell explains, especially when the soft spring leaves grow stiff and brittle with the approach of winter. As we shall soon see, this same cyclical process from life to death (and back again) has shaped human music-making for thousands of years.\n","wordCount":"524","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.colinspear.com/books/music-subversive-history/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Colin Spear","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.colinspear.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
