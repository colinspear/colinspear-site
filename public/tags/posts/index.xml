      <description>Links  Tyler Cowen and David Perell Anna Gat Music: A Subversive History Agnes Callard on the Ezra Klein Show Me, being oh so witty  Motivating questions  How do we know when to push and when to rest, both at the micro level (e.g. in daily/weekly subproject level) and at the macro level (e.g. what projects to take on, when to quit a project)? What is the relationship between striving and acceptance?</description>

      <description>My comparative advantage (the craft of being nice :face_with_open_mouth_vomiting::nauseated_face:) It&amp;rsquo;s not often you see your CFO holding back tears. It&amp;rsquo;s even rarer when the reason he&amp;rsquo;s doing so is because you&amp;rsquo;re being fired.
No, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of a mass layoff or a restructuring or a merger or anything like that. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t very good at my job. We all knew it and I had already been interviewing at other places.</description>

      <description>Hypothesize everything Links / Sources / inspirations  Karl Popper&amp;rsquo;s idea that the scientific method is about Conjectures and Refutations. We make a conjecture, then we gather evidence to test the conjecture.  Motivating questions  What is progress? Truth? How do we evaluate our lives? How do we understand our decisions, make sense of our past and make better decisions going forward?  Outline The formal hypothesis test Do a plain language overview, include some charts.</description>

      <description>Taking big project slowdown seriously Links
 https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/07/why-does-it-take-so-long-build-stuff-these-days/ https://reason.com/2021/03/25/why-does-american-infrastructure-cost-more-and-take-longer-to-build-than-it-used-to/  An evaluation of one (or more) of Patrick Collison&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; projects compared to something similar today
Why might big projects take longer now than in the past?
  Regulation both good and bad
 health and safety environment    other
 more alternatives available now than in the past (even if the alternatives aren&amp;rsquo;t that great)    I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s been a major formalizing of economic, social and political life over the last century that is somehow related to this.</description>

      <description>Motivation The idea was something I was exposed to and sort of absorbed growing up. I remember having a conversation with some friends who clearly held this view. We were talking about Bill Gates and they seemed to be convinced that he was an evil person which just didn&amp;rsquo;t square with my ideas about the economic, intellectual and technological advances from home computing (not to mention the philanthropy of the Gates Foundation).</description>

      <description>Inspired by an exchange between Rob Henderson and David Perell about the importance of &amp;ldquo;being able to get rich&amp;rdquo; as an incentive to draw overeducated people into the internet content production machine1 economy.
Links  unbuilders The cost of running a restaurant  Motivating questions  What are some high value add activities / businesses / sectors where economic returns don&amp;rsquo;t seem to match social benefits? Where is the economic return to business far lower than the social benefit?</description>

      <title>Stoicism vs Sentimentalism</title>

      <description>Stoicism vs Sentimentalism Use Agnes Callard&amp;rsquo;s On Anger as an argument against rationality. In this view the truly rational thing is to hold a grudge and exact revenge forever and ever, amen. It is the irrational dissolution of anger that allows for peace and resolution
Not exactly support for my gotta be irrational to be ethical thesis, but rather the opposite. Anyway, relevant. https://twitter.com/womenpostingws/status/1398786339785433092?s=19</description>
