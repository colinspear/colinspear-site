      <description>Identity goals This is inspired by Atomic Habits. I wrote them when I read the book then forgot about them for some time. After a while I returned to reread them and found it to be a useful recentering device. So I&amp;rsquo;m keeping them for now.
Goals:
 I want to be the type of person who is competent at statistics, machine learning, causal inference and software engineering I don&amp;rsquo;t drink more often than I do drink.</description>
