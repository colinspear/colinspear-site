      <description>Writing  Persistence. How I&amp;rsquo;m bad at it and how important it seems to be. Persistence vs. novelty or curiosity. The way that doing small things over a long time accumulate Rationality and science vs. Narrative and feeling What is my comparative advantage? The insularity of the tech world (thinking of the brouhaha around Basecamp, a company of less than 60 people that was the only thing that people talked about in tech for a week) Vocation and the meaning of work Addiction On being a late bloomer How I&amp;rsquo;ve changed since becoming a parent Reading about fishing as a kid  Other  A podcast that interviews high performers on the sacrifices they&amp;rsquo;ve had to make.</description>

      <description>Confusion I am working through a task at work of reproducing a dataset using a long SQL script consisting of separate chunks of data manipulation and manual edits (to the data table, not the code). As often happens, documentation is less than perfect and I am left to figure out much of what I am doing in my own. This naturally leads to some confusion - what should I be looking for, how do I find an issue to correct, how should I correct the issue when I find it etc.</description>

Canonical answers:
 Develop habits (if you get used to doing the same thing every day out will get easier to do the same thing every day) Organize your physical environment to minimize distraction and promote concentration Minimize your ambition set (i.e. Don&amp;rsquo;t have to many goals) Take care of your mental and physical needs (sleep, exercise, etc)  My strategy:</description>

      <description>Facebook Interesting that there is such a focus on the importance of and focus on privacy during the birth of the company. Is this propoganda, really how it was, or some combination?</description>
