      <description>My comparative advantage (the craft of being nice :face_with_open_mouth_vomiting:ðŸ¤¢) It&amp;rsquo;s not often you see your CFO holding back tears. It&amp;rsquo;s even rarer when the reason he&amp;rsquo;s doing so is because you&amp;rsquo;re being fired.
No, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of a mass layoff or a restructuring or a merger or anything like that. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t very good at my job. We all knew it and I had already been interviewing at other places.</description>
