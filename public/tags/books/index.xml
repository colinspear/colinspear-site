      <description>Frank Martin uncrosses his arms and takes a puff on the cigar. He lets the smoke carry out of his mouth. Then he raises his chin toward the hills and says, &amp;ldquo;Jack London used to have a big place on the other side of this valley. Right over there, behind that green hill you&amp;rsquo;re looking at. But alchohol killed him. Let that be a lesson. He was a better man than any of us.</description>

      <description>Why did Gaspery-Jacques get sent to Ohio where he happened to run into Mirella? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t his decision, was it? Why would the Time Institute want to do that? Was it an accident? It seems too unlikely to be an accident&amp;hellip;
 I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we‚Äôre living at the climax of the story. It‚Äôs a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we‚Äôre uniquely important, that we‚Äôre living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it‚Äôs ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world.</description>

      <description>The world is a musem of passion projects
Music  This Ted Gioia newsletter on how TikTok is changing the incentives of the record business, shifting power away from record labels and into the hands of musicians who are able to find success on the platform. I would love to see this blow up into something.  Covid fallout I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing and reading more about the social and economic effects of Covid and pandemic related actions.</description>

      <description>This book really pits two of my beliefs against one another. On the one hand, I believe the value of specific, physical places and our relationships with them is vastly underrated. It provides meaning, connects us to the past and encourages a deep respect for people and places that is a necessary counterweight to the obvious trends of the ephemeral, impersonal nature of our modern digitized lives. It is the place from which all efforts at conservation should begin.</description>

      <description>Podcasts On existential risk and climate change  80,000 hours: Toby Ord on existential risk Volts podcast  Elizabeth Popp Berman Noah Smith Paulina Jaramillo    These are all just loosely related, but I listened to them all around the same time and found it very interesting to hold the arguments and implications in my head together. Putting climate change in perspective (before the 80,000 hours podcast I had just default assumed climate change was a major existential risk) while still acknowledging the extremely destructive impacts of the warming that is likely to happen.</description>

      <description>Articles   Nadia Eghbal&amp;rsquo;s new work sounds really interesting. Hannah and I have been talking recently about a mutual desire to do more &amp;ldquo;giving&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think either of use really knows what that means to us. This is a really interesting frame for what giving is.
 Philanthropy, then, can be understood as a form of self-expression. It is complementary, not competitive, to government: citizens have the right to use their private assets to experiment with new ideas, and government has the size and longevity to scale and maintain them.</description>

      <description>Articles  A complaint about Google ditching Pixel 3 support. I have a Pixel 3 and sympathize. Google? More like Boo-gle. üëé As the author says: here I am, with another piece of premature junk, made by the company that pledges to ‚Äúmaximize the reuse of finite resources‚Äù and ‚Äúenable others to do the same&amp;rdquo;.  Books  I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to Ted Chiang&amp;rsquo;s collection of short stories, Story of Your Life and Others, on Audible.</description>

      <description>Contains spoilers
This was a great novella. A slow burner, it drops its core themes quickly and densely about three quarters of the way through. Language, time, free-will, purpose, parenting are all front and center in this very human human-alien encounter. I love stories that focus on that slippery line between what we have the ability to change and what we don&amp;rsquo;t and how we make sense of this partial self-determination.</description>

      <description>Associative and non-associative learning From the MIT Open Course Introduction to Psychology
 There are two types of learning: associative learning and non-associative learning. Associative learning is when you learn something new about a new kind of stimulus (that is, an extra stimulus). Non-associative learning is when you&amp;rsquo;re not pairing a stimulus with a behavior. Non-associative learning can be either habituation or sensitization.
Habituation is when repeated exposure to a stimulus decreases an organism&amp;rsquo;s responsiveness to the stimulus.</description>

      <description>Klara and the sun by Kazuo Ishiguro  If Klara is super intelligent, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t she know basic facts about the sum, solar system, planetary motion, etc? There is clearly some sort of some theology. Is it because the sun is all important to their existence that their creators programmed this strange theology in place of basic science? I realize now after having finished the book what an anthropocentric viewpoint the above comment takes.</description>
