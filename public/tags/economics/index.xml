 https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/07/why-does-it-take-so-long-build-stuff-these-days/ https://reason.com/2021/03/25/why-does-american-infrastructure-cost-more-and-take-longer-to-build-than-it-used-to/  An evaluation of one (or more) of Patrick Collison&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; projects compared to something similar today

What are the contours of the Internet&amp;rsquo;s effect on the benefits of colocation? Obviously, being in the same place is still important.
