      <description>Krause describes a memorable encounter with an elder of the Nez Perce tribe named Angus Wilson, who chided him one day: ‚ÄúYou white people know nothing about music. But I‚Äôll teach you something about it if you want.‚Äù The next morning, Krause found himself led to the bank of a stream in northeastern Oregon, where he was motioned to sit quietly on the ground. After a chilly wait, a breeze picked up, and suddenly his surroundings were filled with the sound of a pipe organ chord‚Äîa remarkable occurrence, since no instrument was in sight.</description>
