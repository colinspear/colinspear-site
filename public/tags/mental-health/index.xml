      <description>Kevin Kelly is a national treasure It&amp;rsquo;s true. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, here are some of his projects:
 The Technium is his main blog. Cool Tools is what it says it is. Reviews of cool tools of all sorts. Excellent Advice for Living is his latest book, which seems basically like a set of more intelligible and practical koans encapsulating his vision.  These (and tons of other stuff he makes) are cool and all, but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the specifics of what he&amp;rsquo;s done / made that inspire me, but more his approach and attitude towards life and living.</description>
