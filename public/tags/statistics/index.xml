We make a conjecture, then we gather evidence to test the conjecture.  Motivating questions  What is progress? Truth? How do we evaluate our lives? How do we understand our decisions, make sense of our past and make better decisions going forward?

      <description>Randomization inference Links  Section in Causal Inference, the mixtape Abadie, Athey paper  Randomization inference Just want to think a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about randomization inference
It is an alternative, experiment inspired framework for thinking about and performing causal inference
 Cunningham treats it mostly like a robustness test (from what I can tell) outside of limited contexts, and still maybe in the most appropriate contexts as it&amp;rsquo;s not super mainstream for example, they say that it&amp;rsquo;s especially useful for situations in which, instead of working with a random sample of a population, there is good reason to believe you are working with the entire population itself what does this mean for external validity?</description>
