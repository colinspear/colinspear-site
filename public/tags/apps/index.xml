      <description>Twitter   Tweets on underrated ideas by Ethan Mollick and Derek Thompson. Makes me want to think about the ideas that have had the biggest influence on my recent thinking/doing. The first ones that comes to mind are:
 Small, consistent effort is much more impactful than major, intermittent effort in the long run. Sunk cost fallacy. I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of the simplistic version of this (never make decisions based on past investments), but find that it can be quite useful to deemphasize the past when making decisions about the future.</description>
