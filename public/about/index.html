    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Colin. This is my playground. I share my writing, my notes and my intellectual wanderings here. I hope you can find something of interest amongst the many things that grab my attention. If you do, I would love to hear from you. You can send me an email at <a href="mailto:colinspear@gmail.com">colinspear@gmail.com</a> or find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/colinspear">@colinspear</a>.</p>
<p>By training, I am an economist, a baker, an artist and a student of the Spanish language. By profession, I am a data scientist working in higher education. As you might guess, my interests range broadly.</p>
<p>Purpose of this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>To track the things I learn and share them with people.</li>
<li>To be my digital home. Though I guess it is more of a museum and gallery with an empty front desk and big bell to ring to summon the caretaker.</li>
<li>To be a place that other folks can enter and feel comfortable exploring, spending time and maybe having a cup of tea or a beer in.</li>
<li>To be a jumping off point for conversation and connection and building relationships</li>
<li>To be an archive of what I think, believe and learn over time. To be able to remember who I was and how I&rsquo;ve changed.</li>
</ul>
