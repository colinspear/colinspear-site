<p>I am working through a task at work of reproducing a dataset using a long SQL script consisting of separate chunks of data manipulation and manual edits (to the data table, not the code). As often happens, documentation is less than perfect and I am left to figure out much of what I am doing in my own. This naturally leads to some confusion - what should I be looking for, how do I find an issue to correct, how should I correct the issue when I find it etc.</p>
<p>In grad school, as someone with an unusual background, I also spent a lot of time confused, unsure about how this concept related to that, the interpretation of this coefficient or that derivative.</p>
<p>This feeling of being intellectually unmoored is uncomfortable. It makes my insides itch and triggers the instinct to get up and walk away - go do something else, have a snack (hungry or not), scroll through Twitter, check my email - anything to get away from this sensation of groping in the dark for something whose shape I only have the vaguest impression of.</p>
