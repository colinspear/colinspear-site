<p>Motivating questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the effect of the internet on agglomeration economies?</li>
<li>How much of the benefits of colocation are ameliorated by the internet?</li>
<li>What are the contours of the Internet&rsquo;s effect on the benefits of colocation? Obviously, being in the same place is still important. In what ways can the internet allow people to capture these benefits and in what ways is it still limited? In others words, in what ways can the internet lower the benefits to colocation (or lower the costs of geographical distance) and in what ways can it not?</li>
<li>What benefits of being in the same physical location are affected by the internet and what benefits are not?</li>
<li>What costs to being apart are affected by the internet and what costs are not?</li>
</ul>
<p>My hunch is that well over 50% of the net benefit to being in the same place is retained in the age of the internet. If we just start with the share of output that is physical goods, most of this will not be able to be done remotely, even accounting for support staff (what&rsquo;s the back of the envelope calculation for this). Climate and built environment are also underrated in terms of their importance in what people produce. Asynchronous work is probably not feasible in a decent section of the economy. That&rsquo;s not too mention the number of people who might just prefer going into an office and working in the same place with the same people on the same problems.</p>
<p>What else? Am I overestimating the limits to what can be done remotely?</p>
