 What is the effect of the internet on agglomeration economies? How much of the benefits of colocation are ameliorated by the internet? What are the contours of the Internet&rsquo;s effect on the benefits of colocation? Obviously, being in the same place is still important. In what ways can the internet allow people to capture these benefits and in what ways is it still limited?">

How much of the benefits of colocation are ameliorated by the internet? What are the contours of the Internet’s effect on the benefits of colocation? Obviously, being in the same place is still important. In what ways can the internet allow people to capture these benefits and in what ways is it still limited? In others words, in what ways can the internet lower the benefits to colocation (or lower the costs of geographical distance) and in what ways can it not?
