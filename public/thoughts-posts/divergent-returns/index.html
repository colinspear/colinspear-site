<li>What are some high value add activities / businesses / sectors where economic returns don&rsquo;t seem to match social benefits?</li>
<li>Where is the economic return to business far lower than the social benefit?</li>
<li>What are the career paths (traditional or otherwise) for highly educated, savvy, disciplined individuals outside of the academy?</li>

<p>Unbuilders is a business in Vancouver that deconstructs houses that would otherwise be torn down to salvage with a really creative business model. They charge for deconstruction costs, then donate the reclaimed materials to Habitat for Humanity for resale. What would be a substantially more expensive process becomes substantially less expensive than simply tearing the structure down and hauling the remains to the landfill due to federal and provincial tax credits. I initially though that the donation to Habitat for Humanity was key to obtain the tax credits, but their website doesn&rsquo;t actually specify whether this is true or not. I don&rsquo;t know if they are leveraging multiple tax credits for the donation and for diverting waste from the landfill or what.</p>
<p>Everybody loves restaurants but they are notoriously impossible to make money on, either as an owner or an employee and have very challenging work environments.</p>

<p>This sounds a bit more Orwellian than I intended, but there is enough truth in it that I think is important that I am going to leave it. I believe this particular truth comes from the answer to questions like: How much value does the &ldquo;creator economy&rdquo; actually add? Is net social value positive or negative? What would be the counterfactual career path for Physics PhDs (for example) who go into YouTube content creation instead of a life in the academy? Are these people drawn away from what would be otherwise meaningful careers in nonprofit management, entrepreneurship, politics, etc? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m not overly optimistic about it and fear that the best case scenario is mind tingling infotainment.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
