      <description>Trying to keep up the habit. Hannah and Roan are upstairs, I am down on the ball with Else on my chest.
I got my first dose of the vaccine today. It was surreal and moving. It was administered in the lobby of the UBC Pharmaceutical building, a big, airy space with stairwells and architectural elements protruding from the walls out into space. Temporary dividers were set up so that the line snaked between check in stations where I was given hand sanitizer numerous times along with a mask and a vaccination card.</description>

      <description>Friday, three beers in Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, they&amp;rsquo;re not strong beers.
Tonight I am tired. I have a tired baby on my chest, fisting about being constrained by her carrier. I have a moderate amount of alcohol in my bloodstream which has certainly already begun to metabolize (give me more! says the goblin). I configured a remote server for my new website today and spent two hours on a phone call learning the convoluted, manually adjusted ETL process for one of our reporting tables at work.</description>
