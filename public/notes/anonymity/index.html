    <p>What are the implications of trying to remain anonymous while trying to be part of the new creator economy?</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a new kind of creator economy that is quickly expanding and morphing and dividing and being discussed. Some folks that come to mind that are either creating or speaking about this that come to mind are Nadia Eghbal, David Perell, Anna Gat, Alex Danco, Liminal Warmth, critter I am thinking of some twitter accounts I follow</li>
<li>The importance of reputation (Nadia Eghbal and David Perell talk a bit about this on his podcast) and the way production cadences interact with this. What are the implications of anonymity on maintaining a reputation?</li>
<li>More fundamentally, what is the importance of reputation? What is it&rsquo;s relationship to identity? Does maintaining anonymity have an effect on reputation. My intution tells me that if there is one it would be negative, but then you have folks like Slate Star Codex, Banksy, Satoshi Nakamoto, etc. Who are the great writers that have written under pseudonyms over a long period of time (ones whose true identity were never revealed would be of particular interest.</li>
<li>Why might someone want to be anonymous? Why not? What are the (dis)advantages to doing so?</li>
</ul>
