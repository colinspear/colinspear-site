<li>Devon Zuegel, both <a href="https://perell.com/podcast/devon-zuegel/">on the North Star Podcast</a> and <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/owd-2-vanished-in-guadalajara">with Alain and Marie-Agn√®s Bertaud</a> on their own podcast. She&rsquo;s inspired me to double down on a current tool of thought (writing) and to take much more advantage of another (<a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/contemplating-calendars">the calendar</a>)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything is interesting of you build a mental model for it</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://perell.com/podcast/alex-danco-funding-the-future/">Alex Danco</a> on the North Star Podcast. I particularly liked his discussion of Toronto and the section on <em>the medium is the message</em>. <a href="https://danco.substack.com/">His newsletter</a> has also put a number of things on my reading list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-agnes-callard.html">Agnes Callard</a> on the Ezra Klein Show. I also found <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/acceptance-parenting/">this article on parenting</a> to be thought provoking. I am really excited to listen to and read more of her. This quote is is a giant breath of fresh air:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re way too quick to identify ourselves with the long term goals, especially when we are not in the moment of being tempted. So we can say, look I <em>know</em> how I should really live. I <em>know</em> that I should really read those books, and I should not eat the cookies and I should be less stressed about these things. I should spend more time with my family. These are things I <em>know</em>. <strong>And I think the truth is that I really do not know any of them. I believe them and then I also believe the opposite. And some of my beliefs are more presentable to other people. So I am more presentable to you if I say, yeah I know I should really spend more time with my kids than if I say I have a profound need to escape my kids. But both of those things are true of me.</strong> And I think that the violence to the self occurs as long as they are both true of you. I think, but this is really just me agreeing with Socrates about something, that if you had knowledge, you would not have that conflict. And a lot of people have that goal of mastering themselves - which is to say exerting enough violence over themselves to silence, to quiet that other voice because they <em>know</em> - they say they know - that other thing. But the truth is that the fact that the other voice is there means you don&rsquo;t know it and the violence against the self is the kind of trying to quiet it when it is really there.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.metalearn.net/podcasts/ml147-anna-gat">Anna Gat</a> on the Metalearn podcast. I think that the loss of religion as a driving cultural force is an incredibly important and underappreciated contemporary phenomenon, so I appreciated this quote:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Who builds the - to go back to Leonard Cohen again - the holy places where the races meet? We basically tore these down because they were too confining, but I don&rsquo;t think we have replaced them. And I have been working very hard in building my own holy places in that sense.</p>
