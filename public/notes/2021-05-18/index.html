<li>Devon Zuegel, both <a href="https://perell.com/podcast/devon-zuegel/">on the North Star Podcast</a> and <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/owd-2-vanished-in-guadalajara">with Alain and Marie-Agn√®s Bertaud</a> on their own podcast. She&rsquo;s inspired me to double down on a current tool of thought (writing) and to take much more advantage of another (<a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/contemplating-calendars">the calendar</a>)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything is interesting of you build a mental model for it</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://perell.com/podcast/alex-danco-funding-the-future/">Alex Danco</a> on the North Star Podcast. I particularly liked his discussion of Toronto and the section on <em>the medium is the message</em>. <a href="https://danco.substack.com/">His newsletter</a> has also put a number of things on my reading list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-agnes-callard.html">Agnes Callard</a> on the Ezra Klein Show. I also found <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/acceptance-parenting/">this article on parenting</a> to be thought provoking. I am really excited to listen to and read more of her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.metalearn.net/podcasts/ml147-anna-gat">Anna Gat</a> on the Metalearn podcast. I think that the loss of religion as a driving cultural force is an incredibly important and underappreciated contemporary phenomenon, so I appreciated this quote:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Who builds the - to go back to Leonard Cohen again - the holy places where the races meet? We basically tore these down because they were too confining, but I don&rsquo;t think we have replaced them. And I have been working very hard in building my own holy places in that sense.</p>
