      Stoicism vs Sentimentalism Use Agnes Callard&rsquo;s On Anger as an argument against rationality. In this view the truly rational thing is to hold a grudge and exact revenge forever and ever, amen. It is the irrational dissolution of anger that allows for peace and resolution

      # Craft or crap? The tension between striving and embracing who we are Links  Nietsche vs Kierkegaard Tim Ferris and Brene Brown  When I was much younger, after dropping out of high school in a THC-drenched haze, I spent a lot of time meditating and reading about meditation and buddhist flavored self improvement. I loved it and took it seriously, had a regular practice, attended a regular group meditation, went on retreat and diligently studied the modern western buddhist canon.

      References
 Section in Causal Inference, the mixtape Abadie, Athey paper  Randomization inference Just want to think a bit about what I&rsquo;ve been reading about randomization inference
It is an alternative, experiment inspired framework for thinking about and performing causal inference
 Cunningham treats it mostly like a robustness test (from what I can tell) outside of limited contexts, and still maybe in the most appropriate contexts as it&rsquo;s not super mainstream for example, they say that it&rsquo;s especially useful for situations in which, instead of working with a random sample of a population, there is good reason to believe you are working with the entire population itself what does this mean for external validity?
