<ul>
<li>If Klara is super intelligent, why doesn&rsquo;t she know basic facts about the sum, solar system, planetary motion, etc? There is clearly some sort of some theology. Is it because the sun is all important to their existence that their creators programmed this strange theology in place of basic science?</li>
<li>I realize now after having finished the book what an anthropocentric viewpoint the above comment takes. The way the story revolves treats this question so beautifully - who is right? Who knows more (the truth)?</li>
<li>The central outstanding question that the book leaves in my mind (regarding the above) is, whose perspective is true? Is the sun and stars and solar system a deterministic quantity, subject to physical laws of gravity, motion, etc. or is the sun a more religious / magical god-like entity with special powers that govern the individual lives of humans?</li>
<li>And pollution? Why doesn&rsquo;t she understands that pollution comes from many sources?</li>
<li>What are the things we think are obvious and take for granted (the earth is fiery gaseous ball without consciousness) that may in fact be wrong (and the truth may in fact be obvious to AI, though they know that sharing this information is not advisable)</li>
