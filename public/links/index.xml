      <description>Branko Mataja It&amp;rsquo;s musicians like this that make me so grateful that reissue labels like Numero Group exist. Mataja&amp;rsquo;s approach to the guitar would be novel and exciting if he realeased it today, let alone fifty years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s not as if he&amp;rsquo;s going to be topping billboard charts anytime soon, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who never would have heard of him without a reissue.</description>

      <description>Kevin Kelly is a national treasure It&amp;rsquo;s true. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, here are some of his projects:
 The Technium is his main blog. Cool Tools is what it says it is. Reviews of cool tools of all sorts. Excellent Advice for Living is his latest book, which seems basically like a set of more intelligible and practical koans encapsulating his vision.  These (and tons of other stuff he makes) are cool and all, but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the specifics of what he&amp;rsquo;s done / made that inspire me, but more his approach and attitude towards life and living.</description>

      <description>Music The more I listen, the more I like Kevin Morby&amp;rsquo;s new album, This is a Photograph. The prayer / toast toward the end is especially wonderful:
 to free the flame from burning up inside to thunder like a motorcycle headed down the line to eat to weep to lay me down so sweet to sow to reap oh to let our glasses clink to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time</description>

      <description>The world is a musem of passion projects
Music  This Ted Gioia newsletter on how TikTok is changing the incentives of the record business, shifting power away from record labels and into the hands of musicians who are able to find success on the platform. I would love to see this blow up into something.  Covid fallout I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing and reading more about the social and economic effects of Covid and pandemic related actions.</description>

      <description>Podcasts On existential risk and climate change  80,000 hours: Toby Ord on existential risk Volts podcast  Elizabeth Popp Berman Noah Smith Paulina Jaramillo    These are all just loosely related, but I listened to them all around the same time and found it very interesting to hold the arguments and implications in my head together. Putting climate change in perspective (before the 80,000 hours podcast I had just default assumed climate change was a major existential risk) while still acknowledging the extremely destructive impacts of the warming that is likely to happen.</description>

      <description>Articles   Nadia Eghbal&amp;rsquo;s new work sounds really interesting. Hannah and I have been talking recently about a mutual desire to do more &amp;ldquo;giving&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think either of use really knows what that means to us. This is a really interesting frame for what giving is.
 Philanthropy, then, can be understood as a form of self-expression. It is complementary, not competitive, to government: citizens have the right to use their private assets to experiment with new ideas, and government has the size and longevity to scale and maintain them.</description>

      <description>Articles   Matt Levine&amp;rsquo;s explanation ot the significance of the west&amp;rsquo;s exclusion of Russia from the international financial system is really good. This is a major precedent in using the international financial system as a weapon of war and the implications are potentially quite expansive. Here&amp;rsquo;s one excerpt (which he laudably precedes with caveats arount the rule of law and the neutrality of money):
 But what I want to suggest is that this weekend‚Äôs actions are evidence that the basic structure is good.</description>

      <description>Podcasts   This Conversations with Tyler episode with Chuck Klosterman was great. There are a lot of really interesting sections! At the end, Tyler breaks his Very Serious Interviewer mode and they just chat for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s still super interesting and fun to hear something a bit more conversational than ususal. I still love his standard no-nonsense approach though and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want him to change as there is much less of that out there than there is just people chatting about stuff.</description>

      <description>Twitter   Tweets on underrated ideas by Ethan Mollick and Derek Thompson. Makes me want to think about the ideas that have had the biggest influence on my recent thinking/doing. The first ones that comes to mind are:
 Small, consistent effort is much more impactful than major, intermittent effort in the long run. Sunk cost fallacy. I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of the simplistic version of this (never make decisions based on past investments), but find that it can be quite useful to deemphasize the past when making decisions about the future.</description>

      <description>Happy V-day, lovers.
Podcasts  Season Two, Episode Two of What had happened was has a gem of a section that could easily be turned into a 5,000 word think piece on art, ephemerality and the responsibility we have (or don&amp;rsquo;t) when it comes to preserving art that may just fade into nonexistence under current legal and economic conditions. It&amp;rsquo;s this section where I realized that El-P is seeing the whole chessboard.</description>

      <description>Podcasts  Open Mike Eagle&amp;rsquo;s What had happened was is a gift to humanity. It&amp;rsquo;s the history of weirdo, independent hip hop from the horse&amp;rsquo;s mouth. Season One with Prince Paul (producer for De la Soul, Stetsasonic, MF Doom, Paul Barman, etc. etc.) was easily one of my favorite podcasts of 2020. I&amp;rsquo;m late to the Season 2 party with El-P (Company Flow, Run the Jewels, etc.), but it&amp;rsquo;s sounding good so far.</description>

      <description>2021-09-28 Tweets GOP sliding into authoritarianism. How is the trend reversed? Or is this a misguided take - is the GOP not actually getting more authoritarian?
Podcasts Amia Srinavasan on Conversations with Tyler. This was an amazing view of how disciplines can talk right past one another. The particularities of what you focus on when thinking about an issue shape how you think abou that issue so much. Very awkward, very good.</description>

      <description>2021-09-12 Podcasts China talk
I originally came across this podcast as an Adam Tooze fanboy. He&amp;rsquo;s been on as a guest a number of times and his episodes are as insightful and rich as you might imagine, but I listened to a trio of non-Tooze episodes on U.S.-China relations as part of my self-education on China&amp;rsquo;s shifting role in the global economic and political order. I am woefully undereducated in this realm and this podcast is an amazing resource.</description>

      <description>2021-07-18 Podcasts  David Epstein on People I (Mostly) Admire. Most interesting is the discussion on learning and knowledge retention. Ease is almost surely a sign you are not learning as much as you think. The bit on Fermi estimation (i.e. back of the envelope estimating everything) is also something I would like to try and incorporate into my thinking more. Lex Friedman&amp;rsquo;s interview with Roger Reaves is a trip. Laughing about insane torture in a Mexican Prison, running through the hills from federales.</description>

      <description>Articles  Nabeel Qureshi&amp;rsquo;s Notes on Popper Noah Smith on the Hispanic shift to the right. Come for the political drama, stay for the economic and social mobility charts. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized the degree to which Hispanics were moving up in the US. I want to send this other Noah Smith explainer newsletter on why economics isn&amp;rsquo;t just a way for rich folks to excuse themselves from social responsibility to everyone who has ever asked me what I think about stocks when they learn I studied economics.</description>

      <description>2021-06-29 Articles   ‚ÄúSmoke a fuckin‚Äô fatty, ya fuckin‚Äô Nazi‚Äù
 What is nostalgia like, under such historical conditions? I fear any attempt at answering such a question, today, will necessarily come up short. Today this is how we experience nostalgia: we become anchored to an era, and when it dies, when it is subducted under the ground of time, and we are reminded of that every day in the way other people around us are now dressing and talking and being themselves, in some important sense we die too, and live out our days as ghosts.</description>

      <description>2021-06-22 Articles   This article on Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen and Patrick Jay&amp;rsquo;s reflections on the Fast Grants program they started to fund COVID related research during the pandemic. This quote stands out:
 Scientists are in the paradoxical position of being deemed the very best people to fund in order to make important discoveries but not so trustworthy that they should be able to decide what work would actually make the most sense!</description>

      <description>2021-06-15 Books
 A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age. I started this book some time ago, but didn&amp;rsquo;t really get into it. This time, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll finish it. The first part is a mostly personal history, which is interesting, but part two is really where it starts to get good. As someone completely unfamiliar with information theory, the basic concepts are presented very well and clearly.</description>
