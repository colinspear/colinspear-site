 Remember 01 by The Halluci Nation (formerly A Tribe Called Red), an indigenous Canadian hip-hop group based in Ottawa. Another indigenous Canadian musician, Willie Dunn wrote incredble folk songs about native history, culture and western civilization and politics. He has a great voice and his lyrics are ðŸ‘Œ. Ballad of Crowfoot is a good place to start and one of his best known songs Mabe Fratti. Moving. A Guatemalan cellist making minimalist electronic cello music in Mexico City." />

<p>Articles</p>
<ul>
<li>On Anger by Agnes Callard. She&rsquo;s my new favorite person and this essay is going to be a big part of a future blog post.</li>
<li>Working in Public by Nadia Eghbal (related are this essay and this podcast). The culture and business of open source. The world runs on the stuff and is shockingly under resourced. Related is this Normcore Tech post (maintenance)</li>
<li><a href="https://newcriterion.com/issues/2021/6/the-right-angle">The right angle</a> by James Panero
<ul>
<li>I had a thing for fishing books when I was a kid. Given the prevalence of fishing as a vehicle for storytelling and transmission of wisdom I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the only one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/about/">Works in Progress</a>. I came across them through <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-didnt-suicides-rise-during-covid/">this interesting article</a> investigating the drop in sucides during Covid. Of course it&rsquo;s an Emergent Ventures project :) Oh, and their website is <strong>beautiful</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/05/17/americas-dead-souls/">This awful account</a> of a child inheriting her mother&rsquo;s massive debts after her death. I wonder how widespread this is. In terms of easing suffering, maybe regulating the inheritance of debt has higher societal returns than taxing wealth?</li>
<li>Pitchfork&rsquo;s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-history-of-the-pitchfork-reviews-section-in-38-important-reviews/">25 year retrospective as told through album reviews</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Podcasts</p>
<ul>
<li>The Long Now podcast</li>
<li>North Star Podcast. The man just has so many interesting guests!</li>
<li>Philosophy now podcast. I started writing flashcards as I listed. I would love to work my way through all the episodes, make cards for all of them and share them on <a href="https://newcriterion.com/issues/2021/6/the-right-angle">AnkiWeb</a>.</li>
