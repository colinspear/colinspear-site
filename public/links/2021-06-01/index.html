<li><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/">Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the leisure class - an update</a> This is Rob Henderson&rsquo;s idea that Ellie status is conveyed by displaying a certain set of beliefs in the same way that one might wear a certain hat or handbag or sports car. Interesting and provocative idea, bit I&rsquo;m not convinced. My two big gripes are that knowledge is cheap in the internet age making for low barriers to entry and that is not clear to me how the lower classes bear the costs of adopting these values. Some of the examples are <em>very</em> hand wavy.</li>

Not even for the economics of it (though that is interesting too), but because there&rsquo;s are clear areas where in groups (beef producers, cheese makers, loggers, aluminum manufacturers, etc) so clearly animate for their interests in spite of economic &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;.</li>

If you earn $50k at 23, your income at 37 will be $90k if you are in a job that does not require much decision making versus $112k if you are in a job that requires a high amount of decision making - a difference of 25%. It rises to about 45% around 55: <img src="../static/images/decision-making-earnings.png" alt="Humans beating robots">.</li>
