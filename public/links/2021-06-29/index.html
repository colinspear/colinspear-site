I find the story of Schopenhauer accepting him as a student (after it was made clear he couldn’t pay) after pledging to devote good life to music very compelling. This seems to have had a profound and lasting impact in his life. There is something very powerful about a person you respect making a sacrifice for you as a commitment device. It brings to mind an apprenticeship style of relationship, something that is noticeably absent from professional work today. I experienced some of this as a baker when my bosses decided to take a chance and train me even though I had no experience. That they were willing to take on the risk of investing in me was very meaningful and cemented my loyalty and desire to do good work for them. This sort of personal exchange taking the place of something that in most cases would simply be transactional (fee for service in the case of Cage, matching qualifications and experience for me) has a deep psychological effect that confers a great deal more meaning to one’s work than would otherwise be the case.

The real-life story of the most influential black man passing you’ve never heard. I read The Vanishing Half earlier this year and there were aspects of it I found interesting, but it didn’t move me.
