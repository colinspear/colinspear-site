Articles\n Ross Douthat responding to Marc Andreesen’s reality privilege riff. I don’t know if I buy the basis of the reality privilege argument simply based on my experience as a baker and barista. Also it just feels… wrong. The reality is probably somewhere in the middle, as Douthat suggests, but I’d probably push the counter argument further still. This is something is like to think more about.  Podcasts\n This episode of the Hidden Forces podcast. Rene Girard send to be having a moment. I suspect it has something to do with Peter Thiel Diana Uribe‘s history of Mexico (March 12 is the date of the first episode). This is awesome. Diana Uribe is a cronista, locutora y difusora de historia that had been telling the story of Latin America and the world for over 20 years. She has a wonderfully hyperbolic, magical realist style that makes me feel like I’m intercepting a radio signal from somewhere across the border, thirty years ago.
