[Devon Zuegel on the North Star Podcast](https://perell.com/podcast/devon-zuegel/):

> Everything is interesting of you build a mental model for it 


[Agnes Callard on the Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-agnes-callard.html), minute 40:

> I think we're way too quick to identify ourselves with the long term goals, especially when we are not in the moment of being tempted. So we can say, look I _know_ how I should really live. I _know_ that I should really read those books, and I should not not eat the cookies and I should be less stressed about these things; I should spend more time with my family. These are things  I _know_. And I think the truth is that I really do not know any of them. I believe them and then I also believe the opposite. And some of my beliefs are more presentable to other people. So I am more presentable to you if I say, yeah I know I should really spend more time with my kids than if I say I have a profound need to escape my kids. But both of those things are true of me. And I think that the violence to the self occurs as long as they are both true of you. I think, but this is really just me agreeing with Socrates about something, that if you had knowledge, you would not have that conflict. And a lot of people have that goal of mastering themselves - which is to say exerting enough violence over themselves to silence, to quiet that other voice because they "know", they say they know, that other thing. But the truth is that the fact that the other voice is there means you don't know it and the violence against the self is the kind of trying to quiet it when it is really there.

> Who builds the... to go back to Leonard Cohen again, the holy places where the races (?) meet. We basically tore these down because they were too confining, but I don't think we have replaced them. And I have been working very hard in building my own holy places in that sense.
