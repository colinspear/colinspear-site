# Weirdos and iconoclasts

- [Quentin Crisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Crisp)
- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index)
  - A freelance writer and tech guy. Super original and hard to describe briefly.
- [Dan Reeder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Reeder_(musician))
  - A musician who moved from California to Nuremberg and builds most of the instruments he uses, including recording equipment (computers, amplifiers, microphones and PAs). It's mostly for the latter that I include him here. He writes lovely, little folk songs about mundane daily things that somehow feel like they get at big important universal things.
- James Baldwin
- Elon Musk
  - I don't love including him here because he's such a phenomenon, but I just don't know of another CEO like him.
