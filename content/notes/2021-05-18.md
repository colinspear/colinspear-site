Books:

[Money: The True Story of a Made Up Thing](https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/jacob-goldstein/money/9780316417181/) by Jacob Goldstein. By one of the hosts of Planet Money. Short and interesting, made me want to learn more about the Chinese intellectual and scientific advances from around 600 AD to 1200 AD.

People:

- Devon Zuegel, both [on the North Star Podcast](https://perell.com/podcast/devon-zuegel/) and [with Alain and Marie-AgnÃ¨s Bertaud](https://devonzuegel.com/post/owd-2-vanished-in-guadalajara) on their own podcast. She's inspired me to double down on a current tool of thought (writing) and to take much more advantage of another ([the calendar](https://devonzuegel.com/post/contemplating-calendars))

- [Alex Danco](https://perell.com/podcast/alex-danco-funding-the-future/) on the North Star Podcast. I particularly liked his discussion of Toronto and the section on _the medium is the message_. [His newsletter](https://danco.substack.com/) has also put a number of things on my reading list.

- [Agnes Callard](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-agnes-callard.html) on the Ezra Klein Show. I also found [this article on parenting](https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/acceptance-parenting/) to be thought provoking. I am really excited to listen to and read more of her. This quote is is a giant breath of fresh air:

> I think we're way too quick to identify ourselves with the long term goals, especially when we are not in the moment of being tempted. So we can say, look I _know_ how I should really live. I _know_ that I should really read those books, and I should not eat the cookies and I should be less stressed about these things. I should spend more time with my family. These are things I _know_. **And I think the truth is that I really do not know any of them. I believe them and then I also believe the opposite. And some of my beliefs are more presentable to other people. So I am more presentable to you if I say, yeah I know I should really spend more time with my kids than if I say I have a profound need to escape my kids. But both of those things are true of me.** And I think that the violence to the self occurs as long as they are both true of you. I think, but this is really just me agreeing with Socrates about something, that if you had knowledge, you would not have that conflict. And a lot of people have that goal of mastering themselves - which is to say exerting enough violence over themselves to silence, to quiet that other voice because they _know_ - they say they know - that other thing. But the truth is that the fact that the other voice is there means you don't know it and the violence against the self is the kind of trying to quiet it when it is really there. 

- [Anna Gat](http://www.metalearn.net/podcasts/ml147-anna-gat) on the Metalearn podcast. I think that the loss of religion as a driving cultural force is an incredibly important and underappreciated contemporary phenomenon, so I appreciated this quote:

> Who builds the - to go back to Leonard Cohen again - the holy places where the races meet? We basically tore these down because they were too confining, but I don't think we have replaced them. And I have been working very hard in building my own holy places in that sense.
