> I'm still trying to figure out how to organize the Learning section of the website. Please let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions!


# Things I want to learn more about

- Addiction
- Vocation and work
- Computer science and programming
- Tools for thought and how to learn better
- The cost of housing. Why does it seem to be going up _everywhere_?
