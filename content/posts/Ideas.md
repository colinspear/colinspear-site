# Ideas

- **Persistence.** How I'm bad at it and how important it seems to be. Persistence vs. novelty or curiosity. The way that doing small things over a long time accumulate
- **Rationality** and science vs. Narrative and feeling
- What is **my comparative advantage**?
- **The insularity of the tech world **(the brouhaha around Basecamp, a company of less than 60 people that was the only thing that people talked about in tech for a week)
- a podcast that interviews high performers on the sacrifices they've had to make. But lightly. Not like, what did you have to give up, but more like, what are the oaths you didn't take? Where else could you have ended up? What is your personal life like? What is success? Can you excel in one area and still have a rich and excellent home life, fitness level, etc? _Strauss's Savants (Prodigies?)_
- **Vocation and the meaning of work**
- **Addiction**
- **on being a late bloomer**
- **How I've changed since becoming a parent**
