# Focus

To what extent can we manufacture focus (asking for a friend :tongue_in_cheek_emoji:)

Canonical answers:

1. Develop habits (if you get used to doing the same thing every day out will get easier to do the same thing every day)
2. Organize your physical environment to minimize distraction and promote concentration
3. Minimize your ambition set (i.e. Don't have to many goals)
4. Take care of your mental and physical needs (sleep, exercise, etc)

My strategy

My :100: foolproof strategy for unmatched productivity :chart_with_upwards_trend: and deep flow states! :ocean::muscle:

1. Do everything all the time :rocket:
2. Never organize or clean your work area :put_litter_in_its_place:
3. Be fascinated by each passing thought and dive down all the rabbit holes :shocked_face_with_exploding_head:
4. Sit in the same position until your whole body aches from inactivity :nerd_face:
