Hello!

My name is Colin. This is my playground. I share my writing, my notes and my intellectual wanderings here. I hope you can find something of interest amongst the many things that grab my attention. If you do, I would love to hear from you. You can send me an email at colinspear@gmail.com or find me on Twitter at [@colinspear](https://twitter.com/colinspear).

Purpose of this website:

- To be my digital home. Though I guess it is more of a museum and gallery with an empty front desk and big bell to ring to summon the caretaker.
- To be a place that other folks can enter and feel comfortable exploring, spending time and maybe having a cup of tea or a beer in.
- To be a jumping off point for conversation and connection and building relationships
- To be an archive of what I think, believe and learn over time. To be able to remember who I was and how I've changed.

By training and formal education, I am a baker, an artist, a practitioner of the Spanish language and an economist. By profession, I am a data analyst working in higher education. As you might guess from that list, my interests range broadly. Below you can find a work in progress of some of the things that stimulate my brain:
